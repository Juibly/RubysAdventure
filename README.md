1. Any "known issues" you had with the tutorial if you haven't fully completed it - if you did fully complete it, you can just describe any issues or challenges you ran in to while doing it.

One of the things we had trouble with was importing the files from the others' GitHub onto our own Unity. It would open but none of the assets would load correctly, like it knew where they should go but not what they were. It turns out, you have to import it through GitHub desktop and not just downloading a ZIP of the code from their website. (At least, for us this fixed the issue.) Another issue had was when setting up the Particle System, they didn't have how to do it explicitly in the tutorial for VFX Particle Systems on Creative Core. Their Fire tutorial had a script already made that you just added to a prefab for the part that involves initiating the particle system. I simple just opened the code and broke it down to understand what they were doing, and transferred a similar operation on the Player code for our project. 

The work went well collaboratively, breaking down the project with Vee doing the Particle System and Read Me, while Jakeb did the Game Over and Video.

No external assets used outside of those provided in the Unity Asset Store for the Learning Tutorial.
