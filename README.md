Visual change (50 words) – For the visual changes we added a new enemy, two new collectibles, and a new NPC. The enemy was created by Jakeb using assets from the Sugarland section of the tutorial, and is a vending machine with mechanical wheels. I helped add a blend tree linking to the animations for moving in all four cardinal directions, being fixed, as well as shooting projectiles. However, we were unable to add a mechanic in the code to launch projectiles within the time frame. One of the collectibles was relating to the new Ammo mechanic, and is a spinning gear using one of the in-between frames for the projectile in use for the game. It rotates in a custom animation, also done by Jakeb. The other collectible is for the new speed mechanic, using assets from Sugarland as well. If you eat the candies around the map, you will gain more speed and run faster. I did the animation and the code for that collectible, as well as linking the visuals for the new Duck NPC. The new NPC is used from assets from the Ducko files in the tutorial.
Audio change (50 words) – For the auditory changes, there are new sound effects for all the added mechanics in the game by their respective workers. For the collectibles, I added an eating sound by Paul Morek on Free Sound. When you run out of ammo, there is an audio indicator to provide player feedback, using a metal weapon click sound by Michel Baradari on Open Game Arts. When you complete the game, whether by winning or losing there is a sound cue for each situation. The win sound, accomplished by fixing all the bots, is the win sound effect by Listener on Open Game Arts. The losing sound effect is using a machine turning off sound by Cough-E on Open Game Arts. These are all organized in a sound manager to play in the given triggers. 
Gameplay changes (100 words; roughly 50 words per change) – For the gameplay changes, we have added two new mechanics that are original and significant. I added a speed mechanic, involving collecting candy to give the player a ‘sugar rush’ which ups the speed they can run. There is no cap to this, so if the player can find all of the collectibles they can navigate the map at incredible speeds. If you collect too many, the speed becomes overwhelming and it is difficult to avoid obstacles and aim properly. This also tied into creating audio and visual changes for the other categories. The other gameplay change adds an ammo mechanic to the player’s attack system. Jakeb added an ammo collectible to help refill the player’s attack ability. This increases difficulty by making the player manage and conserve resources by aiming at the appropriate enemies. This has audio and visual feedback, but the majority of Jakeb’s work for the other categories involved the win/lose condition to be better utilized.
